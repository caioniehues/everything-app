## Session Log

### Session: 21/09/2025 00:19:58
**Agent**: Winston (Architect) ‚Üí James (Dev)
**Task**: BMAD Framework Compliance Setup
**Status**: In Progress

#### Activities Performed
1. **Created Required Architecture Documentation** [21/09/2025 00:16:59]
   - ‚úÖ Created `/docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Complete coding conventions
   - ‚úÖ Created `/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` - Technology stack documentation
   - ‚úÖ Created `/docs/architecture/source-tree.md` - Project structure guide
   - Purpose: These files are required by BMAD framework's devLoadAlwaysFiles configuration

2. **Issue Identified**
   - Project started coding (backend infrastructure) before establishing BMAD documentation structure
   - Already completed Story 1.1 (Backend Infrastructure) without proper story files
   - Need to retroactively create story files to comply with BMAD workflow

#### Decisions Made
1. **Documentation First**: Establish all required BMAD documentation before continuing development
2. **Story Extraction**: Extract Epic 1 stories from PRD into individual story files
3. **QA Structure**: Set up QA documentation folders as specified in core-config.yaml

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Extract and create individual story files for Epic 1
- [ ] Set up QA documentation structure
- [ ] Create story status tracking
- [ ] Resume Story 1.3 (Authentication API) with proper BMAD workflow

**Date**: 20/09/2025
**Focus**: Backend Infrastructure with TDD

##### Completed Work
- Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL
- Spring Boot setup with all dependencies
- Domain entities (User, Role, RefreshToken, Event)
- Repository interfaces with custom queries
- Unit tests for domain entities (12 tests passing)
- Integration tests using TestContainers
- Virtual Threads configuration
- Clean architecture package structure

##### Test Coverage
- UserTest: 7 tests passing
- RefreshTokenTest: 5 tests passing
- UserRepositoryTest: Integration tests
- RefreshTokenRepositoryTest: Integration tests

## Technical Decisions Log

### 21/09/2025 - BMAD Framework Integration
**Decision**: Implement full BMAD framework compliance
**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent development workflow
- Provides clear story tracking
- Enables proper QA processes
**Impact**: Need to create missing documentation and story files

### 20/09/2025 - TDD Approach
**Decision**: Enforce Test-Driven Development for all features
**Rationale**:
- Ensures code quality
- Prevents regression
- Documents expected behavior
**Impact**: All new features must have tests written first

### 20/09/2025 - Event Sourcing Implementation
**Decision**: Implement event sourcing for audit trail
**Rationale**:
- Complete audit history for financial data
- Supports CQRS pattern
- Enables event replay
**Impact**: Added Event entity and event_store table

## Error Log

### No Errors Recorded Yet

---

## Performance Notes

### Backend Startup
- Spring Boot with AOT: Expected 40-50% faster startup
- Virtual Threads: Enabled for better concurrency
- Database pool: HikariCP configured with 10 connections

---

## Integration Points

### External Services
1. **PostgreSQL 15**: Running via Docker on port 5432
2. **pgAdmin**: Available at localhost:5050
3. **Swagger UI**: Will be available at /swagger-ui.html (dev profile)

---

## Environment Setup Issues

### Docker Group Permission (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: User needed to be added to docker group
- **Solution**: User added to docker group
- **Status**: Resolved

---

## Code Quality Metrics

### Current Coverage (Backend)
- Domain layer: ~90% (12 tests)
- Repository layer: Integration tests present
- Overall target: 80% business logic, 60% overall

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- BCrypt password hashing
- JWT with refresh token rotation
- Soft delete for data retention
- Audit fields on all entities

### Pending
- Rate limiting configuration
- CORS setup
- SSL/TLS configuration

---

## Migration Notes

### Database Migrations
- Using Liquibase for version control
- Initial schema created
- Migration files in `db/changelog/`

---

## Known Issues

1. **Story Files Missing**: Epic 1 stories need to be extracted into individual files
2. **QA Structure Missing**: QA documentation folders not created
3. **Frontend Untouched**: Flutter project still in starter state

---

## Resource Usage

### Docker Containers
- PostgreSQL: ~100MB RAM
- pgAdmin: ~50MB RAM

### Development Environment
- Java 25: Virtual threads enabled
- Maven: Using wrapper (mvnw)
- Spring Boot: 3.5.6

---

## Session Notes

### BMAD Framework Requirements
The BMAD framework requires:
1. Story files in `/docs/stories/`
2. QA documentation in `/docs/qa/`
3. Debug log (this file) in `/.ai/`
4. Required architecture docs in `/docs/architecture/`

All documentation should include timestamps using `date '+%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S'` format.

---

## Completed Milestones

1. ‚úÖ Backend infrastructure setup
2. ‚úÖ Database schema with Liquibase
3. ‚úÖ Domain entities with tests
4. ‚úÖ Repository layer with integration tests
5. ‚úÖ BMAD required documentation

---

## Active Work Items

1. üîÑ Creating Epic 1 story files
2. üîÑ Setting up QA structure
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Story 1.3: Authentication API (paused for BMAD compliance)
