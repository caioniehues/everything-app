1# Everything App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Establish a unified platform for comprehensive personal and family life management
- Deliver a secure, private finance/budget module as the MVP foundation
- Create an extensible architecture supporting future module integration (tasks, calendar, health)
- Provide intuitive, efficient tools for daily life organization and decision-making
- Maintain complete data ownership and privacy for family-only usage
- Build a sustainable, maintainable system that can evolve with changing life needs

### Background Context
The Everything App addresses the fragmentation of personal life management tools. Currently, managing different aspects of life requires juggling multiple applications, each with its own interface, data silo, and subscription model. This creates friction in daily workflows, makes holistic life planning difficult, and raises privacy concerns with personal data scattered across various third-party services.

By creating a unified, self-hosted platform, the Everything App provides a single source of truth for all personal and family data. Starting with financial management as the cornerstone module, it establishes patterns for data integration, user experience, and security that will extend to future life management modules. This approach ensures complete control over sensitive personal information while enabling powerful cross-module insights and automation.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A modular, widget-based interface that grows with user needs. Starting with essential finance widgets, the design system will scale to accommodate future life management modules. The interface adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop, maintaining usability across all screen sizes while leveraging each platform's strengths.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Widget-based dashboard** with draggable, resizable cards for personalized layouts
- **Mobile-first responsive design** that scales elegantly to desktop
- **Quick actions** accessible via floating action buttons and long-press menus
- **Swipe gestures** for common actions (delete, archive, categorize)
- **Smart search** with natural language queries ("spending last month", "food expenses")
- **Contextual actions** that appear based on current view and data

### Core Screens and Views
- **Adaptive Dashboard** - Configurable widget grid (account cards, budget rings, transaction feed)
- **Accounts Hub** - Card-based account view with quick balance updates
- **Transaction Flow** - Infinite scroll list with inline editing and swipe actions
- **Budget Center** - Visual budget tracking with animated progress indicators
- **Quick Add** - Floating action button with smart transaction entry
- **Analytics Studio** - Interactive charts that respond to touch/mouse exploration
- **Module Launcher** - Future home for task, calendar, health modules
- **Settings Drawer** - Slide-out panel for preferences and family management

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast mode, and scalable text to ensure inclusive family access

### Branding
Modern Material Design 3 (Material You) with dynamic theming based on user preferences. Clean typography, meaningful animations, and consistent spacing that adapts to content.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Flutter responsive design targeting 320px (mobile) to 4K (desktop) with breakpoints at 600px, 900px, and 1200px

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both `/backend` and `/frontend` directories, enabling atomic commits across full stack changes and simplified dependency management.

### Service Architecture
**Modular Monolith** - Single Spring Boot application with clearly separated modules (finance, auth, common). Each module has its own package structure, services, and repositories. Future life management modules (tasks, calendar) start as new packages, can be extracted to microservices if scaling demands.

### Testing Requirements
- **Backend:** JUnit 5 + Mockito for unit tests, TestContainers for integration tests with real PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Flutter widget tests + integration tests using patrol or integration_test package
- **API Testing:** REST Assured for API contract testing
- **Coverage Target:** 80% for business logic, 60% overall
- **Development Helpers:** Seed data scripts, API request collection (Postman/Insomnia)

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ for both development (via Docker) and production, with Flyway for migrations
- **State Management:** Riverpod 2.0 for Flutter state management with proper separation of concerns
- **API Design:** RESTful with versioning (/api/v1/), pagination via Spring Pageable, batch operations support
- **Authentication:** Spring Security with JWT access tokens (15min) and refresh tokens (7 days) with rotation
- **Caching:** Spring Cache abstraction with Caffeine for local caching, Redis optional for distributed setup
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI 3.0 with Swagger UI enabled for development
- **Data Transfer:** DTOs with MapStruct for entity mapping, Jackson for JSON serialization
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose for single-server family deployment, health checks on /actuator/health
- **Monitoring:** Spring Actuator endpoints, optional Prometheus metrics export
- **File Storage:** Local filesystem for imports/exports initially, S3-compatible storage ready
- **Background Jobs:** Spring @Scheduled for recurring transaction processing
- **Currency Data:** Integration with exchangerate-api.com or similar for real-time rates
- **Development Environment:** Hot reload for both Spring Boot DevTools and Flutter

- ✅ Dashboard provides immediate value
- ✅ Import/recurring transactions reduce manual work
- ✅ Desktop/web focus is practical for initial development
- ✅ Mobile deferred appropriately to post-MVP

**Complexity Concerns:** None significant - the modular monolith approach manages complexity well

**Timeline Realism:** With 6 epics of 5 stories each, this represents approximately 150-200 development hours, achievable in 3-6 months of part-time development

### Technical Readiness

**Strengths:**
- Clear technology stack (Spring Boot + Flutter + PostgreSQL)
- Well-defined API structure and security approach
- Proper testing strategy with coverage targets
- Smart state management choice (Riverpod)

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**
- Currency API integration details
- Optimal caching strategy for financial calculations
- Widget performance with many dashboard components
- Transaction import parsing complexity

### Recommendations

1. **Add Success Metrics Section:** Define 3-5 measurable KPIs for MVP success
2. **Create Simple Timeline:** Even rough estimates help set expectations
3. **Detail Backup Strategy:** Specify automated backup schedule and recovery procedures
4. **Plan User Feedback:** Simple feedback form or regular family reviews
5. **Consider Adding:** Brief risk register for technical/scope risks

### Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT:** The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The identified gaps are minor and can be addressed in parallel with architecture work.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
To initiate UX/UI design mode for the Everything App finance module, use this document as input and focus on creating a widget-based, responsive design system using Material Design 3 that scales from desktop to mobile. Prioritize the dashboard experience and ensure all financial data visualization is clear and actionable.

### Architect Prompt
To initiate architecture mode for the Everything App, use this PRD as input to design a modular monolith with Spring Boot 3.5.6 backend and Flutter 3.35.4 frontend. Focus on establishing clean module boundaries for future expansion, implementing secure JWT authentication, and ensuring PostgreSQL database schema supports financial precision. Pay special attention to the caching strategy for dashboard performance and the import framework for multiple file formats.
