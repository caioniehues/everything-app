### Validation Tasks (1 hour)
- [x] Run on web browser
- [x] Run on Linux desktop
- [x] Run on Windows (if available)
- [x] Verify hot reload works
- [x] Run `flutter analyze`
- [x] Run `flutter test`
- [x] Verify build for web
- [x] Check bundle size baseline

## Definition of Done
- [x] Project runs on web and desktop
- [x] All dependencies installed
- [x] No analyzer warnings (critical issues only, style issues from existing code ignored)
- [x] README has clear setup instructions
- [x] Environment configuration working
- [x] Code committed to repository
- [x] Handoff document created for next story

## Dev Notes
- Use Flutter 3.35.4 specifically
- Ensure Dart 3.9.2 compatibility
- Set minimum SDK versions appropriately
- Consider using FVM for Flutter version management
- Document any platform-specific setup required
- Create scripts for common tasks

## Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Platform launches
- **Automated Testing**: Default test passes
- **Test Command**: `flutter test`
- **Analyzer**: `flutter analyze`

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Dependency conflicts | Low | High | Version pinning |
| Platform-specific issues | Medium | Medium | Test on CI early |
| Version incompatibility | Low | High | Use exact versions |

## File List
### Files Created/Modified
- `/frontend/pubspec.yaml` - ✅ Added all required dependencies
- `/frontend/analysis_options.yaml` - ✅ Configured strict linting
- `/frontend/.env.example` - ✅ Already existed with correct variables
- `/frontend/.env` - ✅ Already existed
- `/frontend/README.md` - ✅ Updated with comprehensive setup instructions
- `/frontend/.gitignore` - ✅ Updated to properly ignore .env
- `/frontend/test/initialization_test.dart` - ✅ Created TDD tests

### Validation Commands
```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d chrome
flutter run -d linux  # or windows/macos
flutter build web
```
