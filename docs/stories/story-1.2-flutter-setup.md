# Story 1.2: Flutter Project Structure & Core Setup

## Story
As a developer,
I want to establish the Flutter application structure with routing and state management,
so that we have a scalable frontend foundation.

## Status
**Status**: Draft
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Authentication System
**Started**: Not Started
**Completed**: Not Completed
**Developer**: Unassigned

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Flutter project runs successfully on web and at least one desktop platform
- [ ] Riverpod 2.0 integrated with proper provider scope setup
- [ ] Go_router configured with initial routes (/login, /dashboard, /settings)
- [ ] Project structure created: features/, core/, shared/, with feature-first organization
- [ ] Material Design 3 theme configured with light/dark mode support
- [ ] Responsive layout system implemented with breakpoint utilities
- [ ] API service layer created with Dio HTTP client and error handling
- [ ] Environment configuration for dev/prod API endpoints

## Tasks

### Setup Tasks
- [ ] Initialize proper Flutter project structure
- [ ] Add required dependencies to pubspec.yaml
- [ ] Configure analysis_options.yaml for linting
- [ ] Set up environment configuration files

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create core package structure
  - [ ] Create `/lib/core/config/` with app, theme, and API configurations
  - [ ] Create `/lib/core/constants/` with colors, strings, and dimensions

  - [ ] Create `/lib/core/network/` with API client and interceptors
  - [ ] Create `/lib/core/utils/` with formatters and validators
- [ ] Create feature structure
  - [ ] Set up `/lib/features/` directory
  - [ ] Create auth feature skeleton
  - [ ] Create dashboard feature skeleton
- [ ] Create shared components
  - [ ] Set up `/lib/shared/widgets/` with responsive builder
  - [ ] Create common widgets (loading, error, empty states)
  - [ ] Set up global providers
- [ ] Configure Riverpod
  - [ ] Set up ProviderScope in main.dart
  - [ ] Create provider observer for debugging
  - [ ] Implement code generation setup
- [ ] Configure routing

  - [ ] Set up environment configs

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write widget tests for core components
- [ ] Test responsive layout utilities
- [ ] Test theme switching
- [ ] Test navigation flow
- [ ] Verify API client error handling

### Validation Tasks
- [ ] Run on web browser
- [ ] Run on Linux desktop
- [ ] Run on Windows desktop (if available)
- [ ] Verify hot reload works
- [ ] Confirm routing works correctly
- [ ] Test responsive breakpoints

## Dev Notes
- Use Riverpod code generation for type safety
- Implement feature-first architecture
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Set up proper separation of concerns
- Configure for multi-platform from start

## Testing
- **Widget Tests**: To be implemented
- **Integration Tests**: To be implemented
- **Test Command**: `flutter test`
- **Coverage Target**: 60% overall
