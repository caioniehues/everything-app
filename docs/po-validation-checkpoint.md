| Purpose              | Architecture & Planning Validation    |
| Decision Required By | Before Story 1.2 & 1.3 Implementation |

## Executive Summary

The Everything App architecture is **92% ready** for implementation. Backend infrastructure (Story 1.1) is complete with 90% test coverage. Before proceeding with Story 1.2 (Flutter Setup) and Story 1.3 (Authentication API), we need your validation on key architectural decisions and implementation priorities.

## üü¢ What's Complete

### ‚úÖ Documentation (100% Complete)
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- UI/UX Specifications (simplified, accessibility deferred)
- Frontend Architecture Document (comprehensive)
- Backend Architecture Document
- Coding Standards & Tech Stack
- Story 1.1 Documentation

### ‚úÖ Backend Infrastructure (Story 1.1 - Complete)
- Spring Boot 3.5.6 with Java 25 configured
- PostgreSQL 15 with Docker Compose
- Domain entities: User, Role, RefreshToken, Event
- Repository layer with custom queries
- Liquibase migrations
- **Test Coverage: 90% domain layer**
- Virtual Threads enabled for performance

## üî¥ Critical Decisions Required

### 1. Story Size & Sharding Strategy

**Issue**: Stories 1.2 and 1.3 are large and could block progress.

**Proposal**: Shard into smaller sub-stories for parallel development.

#### Story 1.2: Flutter Setup (Current: ~8 days)
Proposed sharding:
- **1.2.1**: Project Init & Dependencies (1 day)
- **1.2.2**: Core Package Structure (1 day)
- **1.2.3**: Navigation & Routing (2 days)
- **1.2.4**: Theme & Responsive System (2 days)
- **1.2.5**: API Client & Error Handling (2 days)

#### Story 1.3: Authentication API (Current: ~5 days)
Proposed sharding:
- **1.3.1**: JWT Service & Tokens (1 day)
- **1.3.2**: Registration Endpoint (1 day)
- **1.3.3**: Login/Logout Endpoints (1 day)
- **1.3.4**: Security & Rate Limiting (1 day)
- **1.3.5**: Integration Testing (1 day)

**‚ùì Decision Required**:
- [ ] Approve story sharding
- [ ] Keep stories as-is
- [ ] Alternative approach: ___________

### 2. Development Approach

**Option A: Parallel Development** (Recommended)
```
Week 1-2:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend Team: Story 1.3 (Auth API)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Team: Story 1.2 (Flutter Setup)

Week 3:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Both Teams: Story 1.4 (Auth UI Integration)
```

**Option B: Sequential Development**
```
Week 1: Complete all backend auth
Week 2: Start Flutter setup
Week 3: Integrate auth UI
```

**‚ùì Decision Required**:
- [ ] Option A: Parallel Development
- [ ] Option B: Sequential Development

### 3. Technical Stack Validation

#### Frontend Architecture Decisions
| Decision | Choice | Alternative | Risk |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| State Management | Riverpod 2.0 | Bloc, Provider | Low - Industry standard |
| Navigation | go_router | Auto Route | Low - Official solution |
| Local Storage | Hive + Secure Storage | SQLite | Low - Proven combo |
| Design System | Material Design 3 | Custom | Low - Native Flutter |

**‚ùì Approval Required**:
- [X] Approve all technical choices
- [ ] Changes needed: ___________

#### Security Implementation
| Feature | Implementation | Standard |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Password Hashing | BCrypt (strength 12) | Industry Standard |
| Token Expiry | Access: 15min, Refresh: 7 days | OWASP Compliant |
| Rate Limiting | 5 attempts/minute on auth | Conservative |
| Token Rotation | Automatic refresh rotation | Best Practice |

**‚ùì Approval Required**:
- [X] Approve security approach
- [ ] Adjustments needed: ___________

### 4. MVP Scope Confirmation

**Current MVP Definition (8 weeks)**:
- ‚úÖ Epic 1: Foundation & Auth (3 weeks)
- ‚è≥ Epic 2: Core Financial Features (3 weeks)
- ‚è≥ Epic 3: Budget Management (2 weeks)

**Proposed Adjustment**: Defer Epic 3 to v1.1?
- Deliver Epic 1 + 2 as MVP (6 weeks)
- Add Epic 3 post-launch based on user feedback

**‚ùì Decision Required**:
- [X] Keep current scope (8 weeks)
- [ ] Reduce to Epic 1+2 (6 weeks)
- [ ] Other: ___________

### 5. Testing Strategy

**Current Approach**:
- TDD for all backend features (Story 1.1: 90% coverage achieved)
- Widget tests for Flutter UI
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Target: 80% business logic, 60% overall

**‚ùì Validation Required**:
- [X] Continue TDD approach
- [ ] Adjust coverage targets: ___________
- [ ] Skip TDD for UI components

## üü° Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Flutter team blocked by auth API | High | Parallel development with mocked APIs | Dev Lead |
| Story 1.2 too complex | Medium | Shard into sub-stories | Architect |
| Authentication security gaps | High | Security review before production | Security |
| Performance issues with Material 3 | Low | Performance testing in Story 1.2 | Frontend |

## üìä Resource Allocation

### Suggested Team Split
- **Backend Team (2 devs)**: Focus on Story 1.3 (Auth API)
- **Frontend Team (2 devs)**: Focus on Story 1.2 (Flutter Setup)
- **Full Stack (1 dev)**: Support both teams, handle integration

**‚ùì Approval Required**:
- [X] Approve resource allocation
- [ ] Adjustments: ___________

## üéØ Success Metrics

| Milestone | Target Date | Success Criteria |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Auth API Complete | Week 2 | All endpoints tested, 80% coverage |
| Flutter Setup Complete | Week 2 | Navigation, theme, API client working |
| Auth Integration | Week 3 | Login/logout flow functional |
| Epic 2 Start | Week 4 | Account management API begun |

## ‚úÖ Immediate Actions (Upon Approval)

1. **If Story Sharding Approved**:
   - Create sub-story files with detailed tasks
   - Update story status in development-status.md
   - Assign developers to sub-stories

2. **If Parallel Development Approved**:
   - Set up mock auth API for frontend team
   - Create integration test framework
   - Schedule daily sync between teams

3. **Next Implementation Steps**:
   - Backend team starts Story 1.3.1 (JWT Service)
   - Frontend team starts Story 1.2.1 (Project Init)
   - Weekly demos of progress
